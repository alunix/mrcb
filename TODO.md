# Multi Router Configuration Backup TODO

This is summary of features that could be implemented in future after
the basic functionality of the utility is ready:

* mange exports with Git in a _private_ GitHub repository as an option
  to local directory;
* configurable SSH authentication with key instead of passowrd;
* check and remove sensitive data in exports (i.e. as complement to
  hide-sensitive option of /export command);
* e-mail notifications about successful/unsuccessful backups;
* Python 3 support.
